In this section we will compare the CAPEX values obtained for the three scenarios in the three types of dimensioning. For a better analysis of the results will be created the table \ref{table_comparative_opaque_protec_ref_1} (scenario 1), the table \ref{table_comparative_opaque_protec_ref_2} (scenario 2) and the table \ref{table_comparative_opaque_protec_ref_3} (scenario 3) with the different values obtained.\\

\textbf{Low traffic scenario:}

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
 \hline
   & Analytical & ILP & Heuristic \\
 \hline\hline
 Link Cost & 42 124 000 \euro & 22 520 000 \euro & 29 520 000 \euro \\
 Node Cost & 10 058 220 \euro & 4 462 590 \euro & 5 862 590 \euro \\
 CAPEX & \textbf{52 182 220 \euro} & \textbf{26 982 590 \euro} & \textbf{35 382 590 \euro} \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table with different value of CAPEX }
\label{table_comparative_opaque_protec_ref_1}
\end{table}

\vspace{11pt}
Looking at the previous table we can make some comparisons between the several different models of dimensioning and finally draw some conclusions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We can conclude that in this case the dimensioning using ILP is the best (lowest cost).
  \item In comparison with the analytical model we can see that there is a difference considered with a 32\% error, this value is mainly due to the number of optical channels because in the analytical model more optical channels are calculated and used than those required in the ILP model.
  \item In comparison with the heuristic model we can see that there is a small difference with a 11\% error, much smaller than the previous one.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Medium traffic scenario:}

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
 \hline
   & Analytical & ILP & Heuristic \\
 \hline\hline
 Link Cost & 402 140 000 \euro & 199 520 000 \euro & 250 520 000 \euro \\
 Node Cost & 100 050 960 \euro & 39 885 900 \euro & 50 062 590 \euro \\
 CAPEX & \textbf{502 190 960 \euro} & \textbf{239 405 900 \euro} & \textbf{300 582 590 \euro} \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item We can conclude that in this case the dimensioning using ILP is the best (lowest cost).
  \item In comparison with the analytical model we can see that there is a difference considered with a 50\% error.
  \item In comparison with the heuristic model we can see that there is a smaller difference with a 3\% error.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{High traffic scenario:}\\

 \hline
   & Analytical & ILP & Heuristic \\
 \hline\hline
 Link Cost & 800 960 000 \euro & 397 520 000 \euro & 497 520 000 \euro \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item We can conclude that in this case the dimensioning using ILP is the best (lowest cost).
  \item In comparison with the analytical model we can see that there is a difference considered with a 66\% error.
  \item In comparison with the heuristic model we can see that there is a smaller difference with a 2\% error.
