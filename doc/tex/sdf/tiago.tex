The objective of this dissertation is to develop ILP and Heuristic models for networks with translucid transport mode and finally integral in net2plan.

The methodology used for this is defining two networks, one being a reference and the other a realistic one. After being created will be the validation of heuristics with ILPs in the reference network. Finally apply heuristics to the case of realistic network.
