\section{Translucent with 1+1 Protection}
In this case study we focus on the translucent case with 1 + 1 protection.


\subsection{Physical Network Topology}

\subsubsection{Reference Network}
As we can see in the figure, our reference network consists of 6 nodes and 8 Bidirectional links.
The average length of the links was chosen so that the following calculations are more simplistic.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{RedeTeste}
\caption{Physical Topology of the Reference Network.}
\end{figure}

The following table shows the values of the variables associated with this network.
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|| c | c | c||}
 \hline
 Constant & Description & Value \\
 \hline\hline
 N & Number of Nodes & 6 \\
 L & Number of Bidirectional Links & 8 \\
 <$\delta$> & Node out-degree & 2,667 \\
 <len> & Mean Link Length (km) & 500 \\
 <h> & Mean Number of Hops,for Working Paths & 1,533 \\
 <h'> & Mean Number of Hops,for Backup Paths & 2,467 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table of reference network values}
\label{table:1}
\end{table}

As we can see from table \ref{table:1}, to do all the calculations necessary for this project, let us know the value of the traffic used. This value is defined depending on the scenario used, as we can see:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low Traffic: \textbf{0.5 TBits/s}
  \item High Traffic: \textbf{5 TBits/s}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Realistic Network}
The real network chosen for this work is the EON (European Optical Network).
The way the nodes are arranged geographically can be seen from the following figure.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{EON_Rede_Realista}
\caption{Physical Topology of the Realistic Network.}
\end{figure}

The table \ref{table:2} shows the values of the variables associated with this network.
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|| c | c | c||}
 \hline
 Constant & Description & Value \\
 \hline\hline
 N & Number of Nodes & 19 \\
 L & Number of Bidirectional Links & 37 \\
 <$\delta$> & Node out-degree & 3,89 \\
 <len> & Mean Link Length (km) & 753,76 \\
 <h> & Mean Number of Hops,for Working Paths & 2,3 \\
 <h'> & Mean Number of Hops,for Backup Paths & 3,2 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table of realistic network values}
\label{table:2}
\end{table}

Again, to make all the necessary calculations, only the value of the traffic used is missing. This value is set depending on the scenario used, as we can see:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Low Traffic: \textbf{2 TBits/s}
  \item High Traffic: \textbf{20 TBits/s}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dimensioning using ILP models}


\subsection{ILP Results}
In this initial phase the results will be presented using ILP to calculate the CAPEX of the reference network.
For this we will use the following calculation formulas:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{CAPEX}
  \caption{First function is CAPEX cost, second is cost of the links}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{CAPEX2}
  \caption{This function represent the cost of the nodes}
\end{figure}

We will also need a price list that we can see below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{TabValor}
  \caption{Table with costs}
\end{figure}

Finally we will calculate the CAPEX values for the various situations mentioned.

\subsection{Heuristics}
