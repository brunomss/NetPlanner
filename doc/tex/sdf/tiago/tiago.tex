\section{Objective and methodology for the dissertation}

\subsection{Objective}
The objective of this dissertation is to develop ILP and Heuristic models for networks with translucent transport mode and finally integral in net2plan.
To achieve this goal, the following steps must be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop ILP models for opaque, transparent and translucent networks using 1 + 1 protection.
  \item Obtain a solution for network through heuristic algorithms.
  \item Compare and validate the results obtained through the heuristics with the results based on ILP.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
The methodology used in this dissertation is to define two networks (a reference network and another realistic network) and then apply the ILPs to the reference network and to the realistic network.
Subsequently we will develop heuristics that will be generated in Net2Plan and validated based on the comparison with the results obtained from the ILPs.
In addition to being used two networks will also be applied two possible scenarios being one of them with little traffic and the other with much traffic.

This procedure will be done as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Opaque with 1+1 Protection
  \item Transparent with 1+1 Protection
  \item Translucent with 1+1 Protection
\end{enumerate}
