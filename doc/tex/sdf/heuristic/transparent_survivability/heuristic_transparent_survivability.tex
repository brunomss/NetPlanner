\end{tcolorbox}


\vspace{11pt}
In the transparent transport mode (single-hop approach), the signals travel through the network in the optical domain between lightpaths. One advantage of this transport mode is that these networks require optical switching. This enables the realization of ongoing optical connections throughout several links without OEO (optical-electrical-optical) conversions. However, there are performed some conversions in some intermediate nodes.

Transparent optical connections creates lightpaths which require the assignment of a wavelength that will be used to be exchanged by wavelength converters in order to optimize the network and minimize the total CAPEX.

After the creation of the matrices and the network topology, it is necessary to apply the routing and grooming algorithms created. In the end, a report algorithm will be applied to obtain the best CAPEX result for the network in question.

We also must take into account the following particularity of this mode of transport:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N_{OXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
  \item $N_{EXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
\end{itemize}

The minimization of the network CAPEX is made through the equation \ref{Capex_heuristic} where in this case for the cost of nodes we have in consideration the electric cost \ref{Capex_Node_EXC_heuristic} and the optical cost \ref{Capex_Node_OXC_heuristic}.\\

In this case the value of $P_{exc,c,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{EXC_pexc_transparent_heuristic} for short-reach and by the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transparent_heuristic} for long-reach and the value of $P_{oxc,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transparent_heuristic}.\\

The equation \ref{EXC_pexc_transparent_heuristic} refers to the number of short-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$, $P_{exc,c,n}$, i.e. the number of tributary ports with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,c,n} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} D_{nd,c}
\label{EXC_pexc_transparent_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $D_{nd,c}$ are the client demands between nodes $n$ and $d$ with bit rate $c$.\\

\noindent
In this case there is the following particularity:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When $n$=$d$ the value of client demands is always zero, i.e, $D_{nn,c}=0$
\end{itemize}

As previously mentioned, the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_transparent_heuristic} refers to the number of long-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate -1 in node n, $P_{exc,-1,n}$, i.e. the number of add ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,-1,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{nj}^{od}
\label{EXC_pexc2_transparent_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $f_{nj}^{od}$ is the number of optical channels between node $n$ and node $j$ for all demand pairs (od).

\vspace{11pt}
The equation \ref{OXC_poxc_transparent_heuristic} refers to the number of line ports and the number of adding ports of node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{oxc,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} 2 f_{nj}^{od} + \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_{nj}
\label{OXC_poxc_transparent_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $f_{nj}^{od}$ refers to the number of line ports for all demand pairs (od) and $\lambda_{nj}$ refers to the number of add ports.\\

\vspace{11pt}
To implement this heuristic approach there are used algorithms made in Java in a programming software called Eclipse and they are tested in an open-source network program called Net2Plan. In the Net2Plan guide section \ref{net2plan_guide} there is an explanation on how to use and test them in this network planner.

In the next pages it will be described all the steps performed to obtain the final results in the transparent transport mode without survivability. In the figure below \ref{fluxogram_transp_surv} it is shown a fluxogram with the description of this transport mode approach.

\subsubsection{Creation and join the traffic matrices}

\noindent
The first step is to create the traffic matrices based on the reference network \ref{Reference_Network_Topology}. In order to create the 5 traffic matrices in Net2Plan it is necessary the length of all the links and the total traffic used in this network, so later it is needed to define in Net2Plan the length in all end nodes and the total traffic depends on the value of traffic used (low traffic - 0.5 Tbit/s, medium traffic - 5 Tbit/s and high traffic - 10 Tbit/s). As you can see in the figure below, it is defined the path of the 5 ODUs and they will be aggregated in just one single ODU, making it possible to join all the demands in just one file and load it later into the network. This final resulting ODU joins the multiple traffic demands from all the traffic matrices previously created and, of course, the traffic demands will depend on the values used on the creation of the matrices (low, medium and high traffic).

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=7cm]{sdf/heuristic/transparent_survivability/figures/join_matrices_odus}

\label{traffic_matrices_transp_surv_ref}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Creation of the physical topology}

\vspace{11pt}
The next step is to create the allowed physical topology of the network in Net2Plan. This network consists in 6 nodes and 8 bidirectional links. It is now also possible to define the length in all links. In the figure below it is shown the allowed physical topology in this transport mode.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{sdf/heuristic/transparent_survivability/figures/allowed_physical}
\caption{Allowed physical topology. The allowed physical topology is defined by the duct and sites in the field. It is assumed that each duct supports up to 1 bidirectional transmission system and each site supports up to 1 node.}
\label{allowed_physical_surv_transp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Creation of the logical topology}

\vspace{11pt}
It is now time to create the allowed logical topology. A network topology represents how the links and the nodes of the network interconnect with each other and the logical topology algorithm creates the logical topology on another layer. In the transparent transport mode each node connects to each other creating direct links between all nodes in the network. Going through all nodes, if a node has a different index from other one, then creates a shortest and direct link between them. These additions of links between end nodes are made in the new upper layer of the network. The respective demands are saved in the new upper layer and those demands from the lower layer are then removed. The lower layer is the physical layer of the network and it is now created a new upper layer which is the logical layer of the network and represents the logical topology of the transparent transport mode.
The allowed physical and optical topologies, the logical topologies for all ODUs and the resulting physical topology is shown in the next section below \ref{result_description_transparent_heuristic_surv} for the three traffic scenarios. It is shown below three figures with the code in Java of the creation of the network logical topology, the load of the logical topology algorithm in Net2Plan and the resulting allowed optical topology for the transparent transport mode without survivability.

\label{allowed_optical_surv_transparent}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Creation of routes and aggregation of traffic}

\vspace{11pt}
After a network topology is created, it is now time to set the routing algorithm. In the transparent without survivability transport mode the routing algorithm is similar with the one used in opaque transport mode. It starts with going through all the demands and nodes which have different index between them (end nodes), create bidirectional routes (in this case the primary paths) based on the shortest path Dijkstra algorithm and then search the candidate routes for the respective demand. In this report it is used the shortest path type in hops. These routes are ordered sequentially and the shortest one per each demand is the primary path. The demands from the lower layer are removed and then saved in the upper layer. After this step, the routes are saved to a "Set" \ of routes and in each link of end nodes it is set the traffic demands into these routes that will integrate the whole network.

\caption{Table with the description of the main functions in the creation of routes and aggregation of traffic in the grooming algorithm.}
\label{grooming_table_variables_transparent_surv}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Calculation of the number of wavelengths per link}

\vspace{11pt}
The final step of the routing and grooming algorithms is to calculate the number of wavelengths per link for the whole network. This is the last and an important step because with the number of wavelengths per link in the network, it is possible to calculate other network components. In the transparent transport mode, as in the figure below shows, the algorithm starts with going through all the nodes which have different index between them (end nodes) and in all the links that crosses between these pairs of nodes is reserved a link capacity based on the previous traffic aggregation. The total carried traffic in the link including protection and non-protection segments will be divided by the wavelength capacity and it is now possible to obtain the number of wavelengths per link.

\label{grooming_transparent_surv4}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Network cost report}

\vspace{11pt}
In order to obtain the network CAPEX results, the formulas needed to calculate the network elements and that are demonstrated previously in the beginning of this section \ref{heuristic_Transp_Survivability} were "translated" \ into Java code in a cost report algorithm. This algorithm can be loaded in Net2Plan and calculates and shows in tables the network CAPEX and also the per-link and per-node information with more details.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Result description}\label{result_description_transparent_heuristic_surv}

It is already known all the necessary formulas to obtain the CAPEX value for the reference network \ref{Reference_Network_Topology}. As described in the subsection of the network traffic \ref{Reference_Network_Traffic}, it is necessary to obtain three different values of CAPEX for the low (0.5 Tbit/s), medium (5 Tbit/s) and high (10 Tbit/s) traffic. It is used a network software program called Net2Plan which can design the traffic matrices, create all the network topologies, simulate the algorithms into the network implemented in the programming software called Eclipse and analyze the results obtained.\\
In this chapter will be demonstrated the results by Vasco's heuristics from 2016. In each of the three traffic scenarios, it will be shown the network topologies followed by the table with the CAPEX value of the network.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Low Traffic Scenario:}\\

In this scenario we have to take into account the traffic calculated in \ref{low_scenario}. In a first phase we will show the various existing topologies of the network. The first are the allowed topologies, physical and optical topologies, the second are the logical topology for all ODUs and finally the resulting physical topology.\\

\textbf{High Traffic Scenario:}\\

In this scenario we have to take into account the traffic calculated in \ref{high_traffic_scenario}. In a first phase we will show the various existing topologies of the network. The first are the allowed topologies, physical and optical topologies, the second are the logical topology for all ODUs and finally the resulting physical topology.\\

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

Once we have obtained the results for all the scenarios we will now draw some conclusions about these results. For a better analysis of the results will be created the table \ref{table_comparative_transp_surv_heuristic} with the number of line ports, tributary ports and transceivers because they are important values for the cost of CAPEX, the cost of links, the cost of nodes and finally the cost of CAPEX.\\

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Table with different value of CAPEX for this case.}
\label{table_comparative_transp_surv_heuristic}
\end{table}

\noindent
Looking at the previous table we can make some comparisons between the several scenario:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Comparing the low traffic with the others we can see that despite having an increase of factor ten (medium traffic) and factor twenty (high traffic), the same increase does not occur in the final cost (it is lower);
  \subitem This happens because the number of the transceivers is lower than expected which leads by carrying the traffic with less network components and, consequently, the network CAPEX is lower;
  \item Comparing the medium traffic with the high traffic we can see that the increase of the factor is double and in the final cost this factor is very close but still inferior;
  \subitem This happens because the number of the transceivers is also lower but very close to the expected;
  \item Comparing the CAPEX cost per bit we can see that in the low traffic the cost is higher than the medium and high traffic, which in these two cases the value is similar, but still inferior in the higher traffic;
  \subitem This happens because the lower the traffic, the higher CAPEX/bit will be. We can see that in medium and high traffic the results tend to be one closer and lower value.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{13pt}
\subsubsection{Opens Issues}

The creation of this model for any scenario, started with some considerations and some open issues being:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow blocking.
  \subitem The presented model assume that the solution is possible or impossible, does not support a partial solution where some demands are not routed (are blocked);
  \item Allow multiple transmission system.
  \subitem The presented model for each link only supports one transmission system.
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\vspace{11pt}

\subsubsection{Allow Blocking}

\begin{tcolorbox}	
	\begin{tabular}{p{2.75cm} p{0.2cm} p{10.5cm}} 	
		\textbf{Student Name}   &:& Eduardo Fernandes    (09/11/2018 - )\\
		\textbf{Goal}           &:& Allows blocking, i.e., creation of a model that supports a partial solution where some demands are not routed (are blocked).
	\end{tabular}
\end{tcolorbox}

 In figure 1.112 a top level diagram is presented in which it is represented the heuristcs approach implemented behind the developed algorithms. %Next on figure on figure xxx2 the same diagram is presented but in a lower level approach with more detailed information related to the so called super blocks, those that perform more complex functions.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=15cm]{sdf/heuristic/transparent_survivability/figures/fluxogramaSemGroomingHighLevel}
	\caption{High level diagram of the heuristic algorithm performed.}
	\label{fluxogram_transparent_surv}
\end{figure}

As it is shown in figure 1.112, it is needed a Scheduler block which will be responsible for the creation of an ordered queue containing all the demands entering this network, in an order previously defined (based on the demands ODU type), and ready to be routed. 
In order to route those demands there will also be the necessity of a Path Generator block which as its own name implies will create a list of logical paths for each demand between its source and destination nodes, through information received by the Logical Topology Generator block. Next in the Path Tester block where the list of paths previously associated to a demand are tested in order to check their availability in terms of physical capacity in each of the necessary links that comprise the light path used. A Logical and Physical Topology Generators are also needed, the first in order to create the matrix of possible logical connections between nodes and the other to inform us about this network links capacity which will after be continuously updated in the Path Tester block. Finally there are two remaining Sink blocks one to store demands that were routed and their correspondent information and the other to register blocked demands. Both are very usefull to store the information that will later on be present in the final cost report.

%\end{figure}

%Here the main difference is the decomposition of the two super blocks 'Path tester' which is divided in three sub blocks ('Demand path generator', 'Available capacity' and 'Link capacity refresh') and the 'Physical Topology generator' block, divided in two other blocks, all of this in order to better understand their exact functions.

Knowing the list of possible shortest logical paths associated to a demand (Dijkstra algotithm), the capacity of the physical links that constitute those logical connections have to be tested. That will occur in the next block of the diagram, the Path Tester block.\\ \\
If there is already an entry in the light path table and if the remaining capacity of that light path, already established, is sufficient to route the demand then our demand is added to that same light path and a demandPathRoute signal is created with information regarding to the demand/path index, route and wavelength used by that same demand. If on the other side the logical path being tested has not enough capacity to process a certain demand or if there is no light path established between that pair of source and destination nodes than an attempt to create another light path entry will be made. If it occurs successfully than a new light path is established in our network and the demand is routed through that same but if there is no possibility of creating a new light path between those nodes than our logical path will have to be ignored and cutted of, and so a next shortest logical path must be tested in the same manner. In order to in further iterations that full path not be considered a path type signal (RemovedPaths) should be created to inform the Path Generator block that those paths must not be considered, this will make the algorithm more efficient. If finally we can not route our demand though none of the logical paths selected then a blocking state occurs, the demand is not routed and a demandsBlocked signal is created. Then finally a cost report is created to obtain a detailed estimation of the network Capex based on user defined equipment costs present on table 1.28.\\ \\

Having just 4 optical channels per transmission system, each with a capacity of 100 Gbps, and the following traffic model.

These traffic matrices are represented by ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 and ODU4 where each one has a certain bit rate.
The ODU0 corresponds to 1.25 Gbits/s, the ODU1 corresponds to 2.5 Gbits/s, the ODU2 corresponds to 10 Gbits/s, the ODU3 corresponds to 40 Gbits/s and finally the ODU4 corresponds to 100 Gbits/s.
As we can see below, these arrays are bi-directional because they are symmetric arrays and as such, the traffic sent in a certain direction must be the same traffic sent in that opposite direction.

\[
ODU0=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

Through these ODU's we can calculate the total network traffic for this specific scenario:\\

$T_1^0$ = 0x1.25 = 0 Gbits/s \qquad
$T_1^1$ = 0x2.5 = 0 Gbits/s \qquad
$T_1^2$ = 0x10 = 0 Gbits/s \\

$T_1^3$ = 0x40 = 0 Gbits/s \quad
$T_1^4$ = 18x100 = 1800 Gbits/s \\

$T_{1}$ = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1800 = 1800 Gbits/s \qquad
$T$ = 1800/2 = \textbf{900 Gbits/s}\\

Where the variable $T_1^x$ represents the unidirectional traffic of the ODUx, for example, $T_1^0$ represents the unidirectional traffic of the ODU0 and $T_1^1$ represents the unidirectional traffic of the ODU1. The variable $T_{1}$ represents the total of unidirectional traffic that is injected into the network and finally the variable $T$ represents the total of bidirectional traffic.\\

The demands are first ordered in the Scheduler block considering the entry variable, Routing ordering rule (type of ODU), in a single queue. These demands will constitute the SchedulerOut signal.

The demands presented in the previous table will be processed from the lowest to highest index.

\textbf{Demand 1}\\ \\

First of all a set of shortest logical paths will be selected based on the logical topology of our network. The paths selected and how many will depend on entry variables, Criterion and Number of Paths, respectively.
Once our shortest logical path is chosen, we must test the same starting by analysing if there is already an entry on our list of light paths established in the network for that logical link or set of links. If there is none or if the existents do not have enough capacity left to transport our demand an effort must be made to create a new entry, that is, create a new lightpath in that logical link or set of links. \\
In this particular case as the list of lightpaths is initially void we must a create a new lightpath using the direct logical link between nodes 2 and 4, if possible.

Lets now analyze path number 1, supposedly the shortest one.\\

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Path Index & Source Node & Destination Node & Logical links & Hops\\ \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Path type signal.}
	\label{path_signal}
\end{table}

Since it's constituted only by logical link 2 we must test its capacity in order to analyse the possibility of constituting a new ligth path in logical link number 2.	\\

\underline{Initial values}\\

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Logical link 2.}
	\label{logicalLink_variable}
\end{table}

Since its the first light path to be established in this network the index will be equal to 1. In order to see if there is enough capacity to create this light path we will need to test the physical links that constitutes the very same, in this particular example link number 2.\\

All the available capacity of light path 1 was used so it can not be used to route other demands. Other light paths will have to be created to route demands through this link.
