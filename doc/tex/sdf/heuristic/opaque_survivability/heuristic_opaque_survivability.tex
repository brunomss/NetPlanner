\subsubsection{Model description}

In the opaque transport mode (link-by-link approach), the lightpath entering any intermediate node is necessarily terminated, i.e., there are performed OEO (optical-electrical-optical) conversions at every intermediate node since the origin to the destination node. These conversions are used for every wavelength at every node.\\
Contrary to the opaque with dedicated 1+1 protection technique, the opaque without survivability technique does not have a backup path, so if there is a network failure it is more likely to suffer large data losses, which consequently leads to higher network costs. However, the CAPEX will be significantly lower, because that not includes a secondary path that will increase several network elements.\\
After the creation of the matrices and the network topology, it is necessary to apply the routing and grooming algorithms created. In the end, a report algorithm will be applied to obtain the best CAPEX result for the network in question.\\
Firstly, in the opaque transport mode, the optical node cost is 0 because all the ports in the network are electrical. Consequently, to calculate the nodes' cost in this transport mode it only has to be considered the electrical nodes' cost:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $N_{OXC,n}$ = 0, \quad $\forall$ n
  \item $N_{EXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
\end{itemize}

As previously mentioned, equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_opaque_heuristic} refers to the number of long-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate -1 in node $n$, $P_{exc,-1,n}$, i.e., the number of line ports of node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,-1,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{nj}
\label{EXC_pexc1_opaque_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $w_{nj}$ is the number of optical channels between node $n$ and node $j$.

\newpage
\vspace{11pt}
As previously mentioned, equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_opaque_heuristic} refers to the number of short-reach ports of the
electrical switch with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$, $P_{exc,c,n}$, i.e., the number of tributary ports with bit-rate $c$ in node $n$ which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,c,n} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} D_{nd,c}
\label{EXC_pexc2_opaque_heuristic}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $D_{nd,c}$ are the client demands between nodes $n$ and $d$ with bit rate $c$.\\

\noindent
In this case there is the following particularity:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When $n$=$j$, the value of client demands is always zero, i.e, $D_{nn,c}=0$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The function, to be minimized, is the expression \ref{Minimize_Heuristic_CAPEX}.\\

\vspace{11pt}
This heuristic approach consists in four algorithms made in Java in a programming software called Eclipse and testing them in an open-source network program called Net2Plan. In the Net2Plan guide section \ref{net2plan_guide} there is a brief explanation of the algorithms and a demonstration on how to use and test them in this network planner. The logical topology and the grooming algorithms are going to be explained below with more details because they have more substantial differences between the three transport modes used in this report.

\subsubsection{Topologies}
\vspace{11pt}
A network topology represents how the links and the nodes of the network interconnect with each other. These connections are made in the physical (real) and the logical (virtual) topologies and the algorithm creates the logical topology on another layer. The final and resulting physical and optical topologies depend on the method used in each of the transport modes.

In the opaque transport mode the physical and logical topologies are the same, so it is needed to add a new layer from the lower layer (default layer). The respective demands are saved in the new upper layer and those demands from the lower layer are then removed. The lower layer is the physical layer of the network and it is now created a new upper layer which is the logical layer of the network and represents the logical topology of the opaque transport mode.

The allowed topologies, physical and optical topologies, the logical topologies for all ODUs and the resulting physical topology is shown in the next section below \ref{result_description_opaque_heuristic_surv} for the three traffic scenarios.

\subsubsection{Grooming}
\vspace{11pt}
After a network topology is created, it is now time to set the grooming algorithm. This algorithm aggregates the traffic into the network, i.e., in the optical channels that are interconnected between end nodes. This aggregation is made by creating bidirectional routes based on the shortest path type (hops or km). In this report it is used the shortest path type in hops.

In the opaque transport mode the grooming algorithm starts with going through all the demands, create routes (primary paths) and then set the traffic into those routes. One important aspect is that these routes are created based on the shortest path method, comparing all the routes with each other and the final resulting route is the shortest one. As we also have a dedicated 1+1 protection scheme, if the network has this feature, the algorithm will compare the routes again and it will create new routes (backup paths) if they are the next shortest path routes comparing to the previous ones and then set the traffic into those routes. The final resulting backup path routes are used to prevent network failures. Despite of the fact the network will be much more secure, the network CAPEX will increase more than the double, due to the creation of primary and backup paths. The traffic that is carried into the network will be the sum of all the created paths. Knowing the value of the total traffic and the wavelength capacity of all links, it is possible to calculate the number of wavelengths in each link.

It is shown in the next page below a fluxogram with the description of the algorithms and the steps performed to obtain the final results in the opaque transport mode.

\subsubsection{Result description}\label{result_description_opaque_heuristic_surv}

It is already known all the necessary formulas to obtain the CAPEX value for the reference network \ref{Reference_Network_Topology}. As described in the subsection of the network traffic \ref{Reference_Network_Traffic}, it is necessary to obtain three different values of CAPEX for the low (0.5 Tbit/s), medium (5 Tbit/s) and high (10 Tbit/s) traffic. It is used a network software program called Net2Plan which can design the traffic matrices, create all the network topologies, simulate the algorithms into the network implemented in the programming software called Eclipse and analyze the results obtained.\\
In this chapter will be demonstrated the results by Vasco's heuristics from 2016. In each of the three traffic scenarios, it will be shown the network topologies followed by the table with the CAPEX value of the network.\\

\textbf{Low Traffic Scenario:}\\

In this scenario we have to take into account the traffic calculated in \ref{low_scenario}. In a first phase we will show the various existing topologies of the network. The first are the allowed topologies, physical and optical topologies, the second are the logical topology for all ODUs and finally the resulting physical topology.\\

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

Once we have obtained the results for all the scenarios we will now draw some conclusions about these results. For a better analysis of the results will be created the table \ref{table_comparative_opaque_surv_heuristic} with the number of line ports, tributary ports and transceivers because they are important values for the cost of CAPEX, the cost of links, the cost of nodes and finally the cost of CAPEX.\\

\end{table}

Looking at the previous table we can make some comparisons between the several scenario:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Comparing the low traffic with the others we can see that despite having an increase of factor ten (medium traffic) and factor twenty (high traffic), the same increase does not occur in the final cost (it is lower);
  \subitem This happens because the number of the transceivers is lower than expected which leads by carrying the traffic with less network components and, consequently, the network CAPEX is lower;
  \item Comparing the medium traffic with the high traffic we can see that the increase of the factor is double and in the final cost this factor is very close but still inferior;
  \subitem This happens because the number of the transceivers is also lower but very close to the expected;
  \item Comparing the CAPEX cost per bit we can see that in the low traffic the cost is higher than the medium and high traffic, which in these two cases the value is very similar;
  \subitem This happens because the lower the traffic, the higher CAPEX/bit will be. We can see that in medium and high traffic the results tend to be one closer value.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Opens Issues}

The creation of this model for any scenario, started with some considerations and some open issues being:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow blocking.
  \subitem The presented model assume that the solution is possible or impossible, does not support a partial solution where some demands are not routed (are blocked);
  \item Allow multiple transmission system.
  \subitem The presented model for each link only supports one transmission system;
  \item Allowing multi-path routing.
  \subitem The presented model for all demands sharing the same node pairs have to follow the same path.
\end{itemize}
