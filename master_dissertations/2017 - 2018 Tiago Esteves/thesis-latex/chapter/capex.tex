\chapter{Capital Expenditure}
\label{chap_capex}
The cost of a telecommunications network can be divided into capital and operational expenditures. The CAPEX is the amount of money needed to set up and install a particular network and the OPEX is the amount of money needed to run this network as well as its maintenance and operation over time \cite{capex}\cite{opex}\cite{aulas}. In this section we will only focus on CAPEX, that is, the costs of installing a particular network.
The current chapter is to propose and describe an optimization model to calculate capital expenditures of the network using as a tool ILP models and analytical models. These calculations are made based on the three modes of transport (opaque, transparent and translucent) with 1+1 protection and without survivability.
In the section \ref{ILP_CAPEX} it is described how the network CAPEX is calculated using ILP models and in its subsections, the calculations and constraints of the three transport modes mentioned above are identified.
In the section\ref{analytical_CAPEX} it is described how the network CAPEX is calculated using analytical models and in its subsections, the calculations and constraints of the opaque and transparent modes of transport are identified.
