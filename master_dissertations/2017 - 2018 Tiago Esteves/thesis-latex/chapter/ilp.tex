\chapter{Integer Linear Programming}
\label{chap_ilp}
ILP models are used to design networks that describe real components and their capabilities through a set of linear equations. Despite their quality, the solutions obtained through these models, depending on the number of variables and computational resources, can take days, months or even years \cite{ILP01}.
The current chapter is to propose and describe an optimization model for calculating the capital expenditures of the network, based on the three modes of transport (opaque, transparent and translucent) without survivability and protection.
In the following sections it is proposed in detail the restrictions of the three models previously mentioned, without survivability and with protection as well as a detailed report of the obtained results for each case.
