\chapter{Network Specification}
\label{chap_reference_network}
The purpose of this chapter is to describe a state-of-art review about optical transport networks and finally describe a reference network that will be used for the various types of dimensioning throughout this dissertation. In addition to the reference network will also be described the various traffic models used in this network in question.\\
The organization of this chapter is done by creating four subsections, the first \ref{network_components} refers to the components of the network, the second \ref{network_topologies} depicts the topologies of the network and in the third \ref{transport_mode} it is possible to describe the different types of mode of transport at the end in the last \ref{reference_network} to describe the physical topology of the network and a to create the traffic matrix for the three existing traffic models (low, medium and high traffic).\\
