\subsection{Opaque transport mode}\label{ILP_Opaque_Mode}

Before carrying out the description of the objective function we must take into account the following particularity of this mode of transport:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N_{OXC,n}$ = 0, \quad $\forall$ n
  \item $N_{EXC,n}$ = 1, \quad $\forall$ n that process traffic
\end{itemize}

\vspace{11pt}
The objective function of following the ILP is a minimization of the CAPEX through the equation \ref{Capex} where in this case for the cost of nodes we only have in consideration the electric cost \ref{Capex_Node_EXC} because of the particularity previously mentioned.
In this case the value of $P_{exc,c,n}$ is obtained by equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_opaque} for long-reach and by the equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_opaque} for short-reach.\\

As previously mentioned, equation \ref{EXC_pexc1_opaque} refers to the number of long-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate -1 in node n, $P_{exc,-1,n}$, i.e. the number of line ports of node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,-1,n} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_{nj}
\label{EXC_pexc1_opaque}
\end{equation}
\vspace{11pt}

\noindent
where $w_{nj}$ is the number of optical channels between node $n$ and node $j$.\\

As previously mentioned, equation \ref{EXC_pexc2_opaque} refers to the number of short-reach ports of the electrical switch with bit-rate c in node n, $P_{exc,c,n}$, i.e. the number of tributary ports with bit-rate c in node n which can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
P_{exc,c,n} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} D_{nd,c}
\label{EXC_pexc2_opaque}
\end{equation}

\vspace{11pt}
\noindent
where $D_{nd,c}$ are the client demands between nodes $n$ and $d$ with bit rate $c$.\\

In this case there is the following particularity:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When $n$=$d$ the value of client demands is always zero, i.e, $D_{nn,c}=0$
\end{itemize}
