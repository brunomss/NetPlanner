\subsection{Conclusions}

Once we have obtained the results for all the scenarios we will now draw some conclusions about these results. For a better analysis of the results will be created the table \ref{table_comparative_transluc_protec}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\label{table_comparative_transluc_protec}
\end{table}

Looking at the previous table we can make some comparisons between the several scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing the low traffic with the others we can see that despite having an increase of factor ten (medium traffic) and factor twenty (high traffic), the same increase does not occur in the final cost (it is lower). This happens because the number of the transceivers is lower than expected which leads by carrying the traffic with less network components and, consequently, the network CAPEX is lower.
  \item Comparing the medium traffic with the high traffic we can see that the increase of the factor is double and in the final cost this factor is very close but still inferior. This happens because the number of the transceivers is also lower but very close to the expected.
  \item Comparing the CAPEX cost per bit we can see that in the low traffic the cost is higher than the medium and high traffic, which in these two cases the value is similar, but still inferior in the higher traffic. This happens because the higher the traffic, the lower CAPEX/Gbit/s will be. We can see that in medium and high traffic the results tend to be one closer and lower value.
  \item Comparing this cost with the without survivability cost we can conclude that protection is significantly more expensive. As can be seen in the table this increase is approximately double as with 1+1 protection we have a cost more than twice than the cost without survivability.
\end{itemize}
